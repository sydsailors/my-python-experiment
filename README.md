This page provides instructions to create a new repository in GitHub with a default README file.
If the repository is created without a README, it will not work the same when cloned. If this happens, delete the repository and start over, ensuring a default README is included.

Steps to Create a New Repository in GitHub
Log in to GitHub. Open your browser and log in to your GitHub account.

Go to the "Create Repository" Page

In the top-right corner of GitHub, click the + dropdown menu.
Select New repository.
Name Your Repository

Enter a name for your new repository.
IMPORTANT: Follow Naming Guidelines for Python Projects:
Use all lowercase.
Use dashes between words.
NEVER USE spaces or special characters.
Good Examples: my-python-project, python-experiments, baseball-stats, python-personal-project, website-analytics, student-impact-analysis
Provide a brief description of your project. This is optional but recommended.

Select the Public option so others can view your repository. You may always use a fake name.

IMPORTANT: Add a Default README File

Check the box for Add a README file. This file is essential for cloning and initializing your project.
Click the Create repository button to finalize the process and create your repo in GitHub.
